# eodc_testing

**DRAFT:** This repository is a work-in-progress for setting up automated tests for services like the STAC API and for validating notebooks from the eodc-examples repository using GitHub Actions.

The tests are designed to ensure the reliability of:

- **STAC API services** â€“ validating endpoints and data integrity.

- **Jupyter notebooks** in the eodc-examples repository â€“ testing imports and functionality.
